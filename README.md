## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Vite

### What I learned

I learned to create a slider with javascript.

### Continued development

I plan to build more projects using vanilla javascript and improve myself more with css animations so I don't get too dependent on frameworks

### Useful resources

- [Webdev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HcxHDS2w1s) - This video helped me building the slider.
