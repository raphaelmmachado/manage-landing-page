## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Screenshot

![screenshot](./images/ss.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Vite

### What I learned

I learned to create a slider with javascript.

### Continued development

I plan to build more projects using vanilla javascript and improve myself more with css animations so I don't get too dependent on frameworks

### Useful resources

- [Webdev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HcxHDS2w1s) - This video helped me building the slider.
